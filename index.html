       <div class="tntt"> <p> She has been in TN for 13 years now and is currently a Huynh Truong for Doan Duc Me Thanh Tam. She has pondered for a long time now whether it is right for her to become a HT. Does she just want to become a HT because thats just the next step of any hiep si or does she truly want to become a leader for tn. Growing up with TN being a very influential in her life, she feels like it is natural for her to become a leader. She loves being involved with TN from teaching dances like dang hoa and bon mang, to helping the HTs with whatever they need help with. She initially thought that the only thing holding her back from quiting TN were her friends, but actually, the actual thing that keeps her going to tn are the teachings and morals that the groups instills in her. TN has taught her many life lessons and she gives credit to the HTs for that. They share their own life stories and experiences to motivate us to become not only better catholics, but better people as well. Her motivation to become a HT are these role models and she wants to make a difference in a person's life just like how they did for her. She wants to be a leader that encourages people when they feel down. She wants to be a leader that guides people to the right path just like how the pope urges us to undertake a journey of discernment to discover God's plan in your life. She wants to remind people that they are not alone even if they feel like they are because God is by your side and even if life sucks right now, it will be better and God will take your hand through that hardship and make you a better person. </p>
        <p1> Lilian loves everything about TN and she will never quit. She just does not want to be in any leadership position because it is a lot of responsibility and she does not want to hurt those around her.</p1>
